*work in progress!*
Water Quality Project: Sioux Falls recently noted measurable quantities of "forever chemicals" in the water supply. In investigating a water quality data set for the Sioux Falls area, I noticed that the average pH of the surface water was significantly above the expected pH of 7.4. Even if the contributions to overall alkalinity from the rock types found in the Big Sioux River Basin, an average alkalinity of ~8.5 is roughly 10 times that expected for surface water (pH = 7.4). Further data exploration revealed that there are a significant number of outliers present and that the outliers are not uniformly distributed around the interquartile range.
Work that remains to be done: 
-determine a relationship between air temperature and water temperature to fill in ~400 missing water temperature values for the five water sampling stations tracked in the data set.
-determine whether the numerous outliers are due to instrumental error or indicative of local pollution events
